Tuning macros
Useful macros for tuning (same as in BoehmGC):
GC_DLL - compile to produce a DLL (gc.dll);
ALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS - turn on "all-interior-pointers" mode by default;
GC_GCJ_SUPPORT - compile with GCJ-style allocation support;
GC_THREADS - compile with thread support (pthread-based by default);
GC_WIN32_THREADS - compile with Win32-based thread support;
JAVA_FINALIZATION_NOT_NEEDED - exclude GC_finalize_all() from the API;
DONT_ADD_BYTE_AT_END - do not pad objects even if "all-interior-pointers" mode is on;
FINALIZE_ON_DEMAND - causes finalizers to be run only in response to explicit GC_invoke_finalizers() calls by default (unless overridden at run-time);
GC_IGNORE_GCJ_INFO - disable GCJ-style type information (useful for debugging);
GC_DONT_EXPAND - do not implicitly expand the heap by default (unless overridden at run-time);
GC_INITIAL_HEAP_SIZE=<value> - set the desired default initial heap size (in bytes);
GC_FREE_SPACE_DIVISOR=<value> - the default trade-off between garbage collection and heap growth;
GC_MAX_RETRIES=<value> - the default maximum number of garbage collections attempted before reporting out of memory after a heap expansion failure.

Useful macros for client application tuning (same as in BoehmGC):
GC_DONT_EXPAND - do not implicitly expand the heap (unless overridden at run-time);
GC_DLL - use TinyGC residing in a DLL;
GC_THREADS - declare the prototypes for the collector multi-threading support;
GC_CALL=<calling_conv> - explicitly specify calling convention for the GC API functions;
GC_CALLBACK=<calling_conv> - explicitly specify an alternate calling convention for the GC API user callbacks;
GC_INITIAL_HEAP_SIZE=<value> - set the desired initial heap size (in bytes);
GC_MAXIMUM_HEAP_SIZE=<value> - set the desired maximum heap size (in bytes);
GC_FREE_SPACE_DIVISOR=<value> - set the desired trade-off between garbage collection and heap growth;
GC_MAX_RETRIES=<value> - set the desired maximum number of garbage collections attempted before reporting out of memory after a heap expansion failure.

Environment variables
Environment variables recognized (if supported, same as in BoehmGC):
GC_DONT_GC - turn off garbage collection;
GC_PRINT_STATS - turn on statistic printing on every garbage collection (if supported);
GC_ALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS - turn on "all-interior-pointers" collector mode;
GC_IGNORE_GCJ_INFO - ignore the GCJ-style type descriptors (if supported);
GC_INITIAL_HEAP_SIZE=<value> - set the initial heap size (in bytes);
GC_MAXIMUM_HEAP_SIZE=<value> - set the maximum heap size (in bytes);
GC_FREE_SPACE_DIVISOR=<value> - change the default trade-off between garbage collection and heap growth.
Note: the values assigned to the specified environment variables override the similar default (or the preset at the compilation time) values.


Q:What can I do to maximize allocation performance?
A:Here are some hints:
Use GC_MALLOC_ATOMIC where possible.
For a multithreaded application, take advantage of gc_local_alloc.h to avoid locking on each allocation.
For a single-threaded application, use a GC library without thread support. If this is inconvenient, use gc_local_alloc.h.
If you use large statically allocated arrays or mapped files, consider GC_exclude_static_roots.

Q:If my heap uses 2 GB on a 32-bit machine, won't every other integer or other random data be misinterpreted as a pointer by the collector? Thus won't way too much memory be retained?

A:Maybe. Probably, if the collector is used purely conservatively, with no pointer layout information (such as use of GC_MALLOC_ATOMIC).
With a gigabyte heap, you are clearly much better off on a 64-bit machine. Empirical evidence seems to suggest that some such applications work on a 32-bit machine, and others don't perform acceptably.
Simple probability calculations for pointer misidentifications are generally incorrect. The probability of misinterpreting an integer is typically reduced significantly by a number of collector features and fortunate accidents. Most integers are small, and small integers can generally not be heap addresses. The collector black-listing mechanism avoids allocating areas that are prone to be targets of misinterpreted references. The collector can be told to ignore some or all pointers to object interiors.
